# What is a linked list? 
    - A data structure that contains a head, tail, and length propery.
    - Linked lists consist of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to anohter node or null.
    - No indices like with an array.   

## Linked Lists vs Arrays
### Lists
    * Do not have indices!
    * Connected via nodes with a next pointer.
    * Random access is not allowed.

### Arrays
    * Indexed in order!
    * Insertion and deletion can be expensive.
    * Can quickly be accessed at a specific index.
