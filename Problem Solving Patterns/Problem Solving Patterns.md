# How to improve at algorithms / solving problems? 
 
## 1. Devise a plan for solving problems (Not fool-proof)

### Understand the problem
    - Restate the problem in your own words.
    - What are inputs that go into the problem?
    - What are the outputs we are trying to return?
    - Can outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do i have enough information to solve the problem?
    - How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem?
`
    Write a function that takes two numbers and return their sum
`
